# ICC Test Cricket Data Analysis

## Problem Statement
Despite having access to extensive ICC Test cricket data, identifying and selecting top-performing batsmen for a team remains a significant challenge for cricket analysts and team selectors. As a result, there is a pressing need to develop a comprehensive and objective approach to identify and evaluate the performance of top-performing batsmen. The primary task to accomplish from the data is analysing it and looking at various factors in order to create best possible groups of batsmen using DBMS.

## Description
In the dataset, there were 12 columns and 3001 rows. Since the file had missing values represented by hyphens (-), we first imported the missing value columns as text so as to not leave any records from the file. Then we updated the table replacing all the hyphens with NULL values. SQL techniques such as subqueries and views were used to analyse the data.

## Outcome
5 groups of 6 batsmen each were identified based on different performance measures such as average score and number of centuries.

## Key Skills Used
MySQL, SQL Commands, Functions, Operators, Subqueries, Views
